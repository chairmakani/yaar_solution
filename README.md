# E-commerce Project

This is a Django-based e-commerce platform designed with a mobile-responsive layout and integrated payment gateway for UPI payments. It supports manual payment verification and order confirmation.

## Project Structure


## Admin Panel

The project comes with a built-in Django admin panel to manage:

- **Products** (Add, Update, Delete)
- **Categories** (Add, Update, Delete)
- **Orders** (View, Update Order Status)
- **User Accounts**

To access the admin panel, create a superuser and visit [http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/).

## Mobile-Responsive Design

The platform is designed with responsiveness in mind, adapting seamlessly from grid view to list view depending on screen size:

- **Grid View** (Mobile): Displays product image, name, price, and "Add to Cart" button.
- **List View** (Large screens): Displays full product details, including tax information, stock status, and descriptions.
